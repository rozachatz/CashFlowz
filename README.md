## Logging & Exception Handling

Using @ControllerAdvice for exception handling and logging.

## Testing
Unit and integration tests with Junit-5 and @TestContainers.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC 1: Happy path
- AC 2: Insufficient balance
- AC 3: Transfer in the same account
- AC 4: Source/target account does not exist

## Docker

Build the project and let the magic âœ¨ happen by executing:

````bash
docker compose up --build
````

That's all you need, everything is set up for you :)

You can of course play with whatever database/cache/migration tool you like (I use Postgres, Redis and Flyway) by
modifying the docker-compose.yml file.

Have fun!
